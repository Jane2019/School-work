# Finance analysis on Piotroski score

On my AI in finance course, I have recapped unsupervised learning algorithm and learnt deep learning in a nutshell.

I have done a finance project with 3 other members, I am the one who participated the programming task through the whole project and also concluded the key information in presentation.

## Table of contents

  - Objective
    - Calculate the PIO score using 9 criterion for each stock each day downloaded from WRDS
    - Build Random Forest classifier regarding whether the daily return is positive or negative
    - Compare the results with the PIO score calculated by ratios
  
  - Good points
    - PIO score combination with Python
    - Use of backfill in data mining
    - Random Forest hyperparameter tuning
    - Feature importance
    
  - Future work
    - Separate small and medium cap stocks
    - Compare average values of Piotroski score in different sectors
    - Implement with other cross-sectional models such as logistic regression
