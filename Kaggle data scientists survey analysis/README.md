# Kaggle data scientists survey analysis

[Here is the link directly to Kaggle](hhttps://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018)

In a whole, this is a regression project with feature engineering. Mainly use multiple_choice_responses.csv that can be retrieved in the link above and rearranged to randomly assign each peason's salary according their salary range in Q9 for regression, renamed as Kaggle_Salary.csv and used in the project. The survey results from 15429 participants are shown in 395 columns, representing 50+ survey questions.

The purpose of this challenge is to â€œtell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.
