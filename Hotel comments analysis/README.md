# Hotel comments analysis project

The dataset is crawlled from Tripadvisor, which is part of hotels reviews in Calgary.

The main task of this project is to familiar with nltk and the Vader sentiment in that library, which are very useful tools for sentiment analysis and NLP projects.

I will analyze the rating score, sentiment score by Vader and explore the top 5 and bottom 5 hotels; then figure out 50 most frequent words in review and finally explore the relationship between number of reviews and sentiment score, length of reviews and sentiment score.

## Good points

- Sentiment analysis

- Vader score

- Mutual information

- Frequency words analysis

- Plots (Histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatterplots)
