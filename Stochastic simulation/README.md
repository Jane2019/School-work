# Stochastic simulation

This is a group project of two. We are trying to do the queue waiting time simulation in big supermarkets, e.g. Loblaws.

The topic is self-decided and this topic comes to our mind because of curiosity when observe the supermarket daily operations.

We all know supermarkets now have self-checkout machines and Express checkout counter when you buy fewer items.

This project will solving several interesting questions:
  
  - Scenario I: How long is the waiting time when customers all go through the standard counters.
  
  - Scenario II: Will the waiting time decrease when some customers are introduced to self-checkout system.
  
  - Scenario III: How about the waiting time now if some customer go to Express.
  
  We just did the queue simulation, not involve the labour cost and system cost optimazition, that is another big project :)
  
  We used Simpy and part of the code is provided in the class by the coordinator.
